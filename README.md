4501 Project
Description: This project is aimed to solve the situation in this case: Your apartment lease is ending at the end of the year, and you need to find a new apartment. 
There are a lot of criteria you can use to help find a neighborhood you’d like to live in. One thing you care a lot about is a quiet neighborhood with a lot of 
greenery. We use the NYC Open Data datasets and Zillow’s historic monthly rent averages, you will be creating a single Jupyter notebook to download, clean, and store 
data, as well as defining a set of SQL queries and visualizations to help answer questions of yours in search of a great area to live within your budget.
